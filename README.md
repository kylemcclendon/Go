Go Programs


This repository holds programs coded in the Go programming language.

Dull.go:
  Modeled after http://mcicpc.cs.atu.edu/archives/2009/mcpc2009/dull/dull.html, the program was written blind, having
  not seen the judge's or any other existing code of the problem. The program was written in its unoptimized form in
  approximately 6 hours time. Normal ACM contests run for 5 hours, using languages already learned. Following the Go
  tour and utilizing Google groups, I learned the basics of Go in a week's time, and was able to successfully code this
  program and produce the correct output.
